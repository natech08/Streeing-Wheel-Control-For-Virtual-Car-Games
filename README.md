# Streeing-Wheel-Control-For-Virtual-Car-Games

# Project Description

In this project, there is Steering wheel and acceleration, brake and gear to drive a virtual car in video games. 
Which is entirely interfaced with a micro-controller following up with several procedure.
The Microcontroller is then programmed as per the key board requirment so that to sync the games controls with the streeing wheel, break and gear shifts.
However, this is developed in raw manner but this seems to be very smooth in its operating sense.

# Technology

Arduino, Firmware shifting, Joystick drivers.
